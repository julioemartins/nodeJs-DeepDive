# Node.js Deep Dive – Learning by Experiments

## Motivation
I’m an experienced software engineer and technology leader, but in a recent interview I realized that my fluency in some **Node.js fundamentals** wasn’t sharp enough. c 

Since my main career goal is to relocate to Portugal and work either as a **Team Lead** or as a **hands-on Developer**, I created this repository as a structured learning journey. Here I document my experiments with Node.js, going beyond surface usage to understand and explain the **core mechanics** behind it.  

This is not just about coding. it’s about making sure I can **lead teams with confidence** while still being able to dive deep into the technical details whenever needed.  

## Goals
- Strengthen mastery of Node.js fundamentals.  
- Document each concept with **clear explanations + runnable code**.  
- Build confidence for technical interviews and leadership roles.  
- Turn mistakes into growth and mastery.  

## Repository Structure
Each folder covers one Node.js concept:
- `event-loop/` – Understanding how the call stack, microtasks, and macrotasks work.  
- `async-io/` – How Node.js simulates async for blocking operations.  
- `streams/` – Working with streams and backpressure.  
- (more coming soon…)

## Progress
- [x] Event Loop  
- [ ] Async I/O  
- [ ] Streams  
- [ ] Clusters & Worker Threads  
- [ ] Error Handling Patterns
